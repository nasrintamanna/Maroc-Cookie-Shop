# Maroc-Cookie-Shop

Maroc cookies is a new pastry shop established in the north-central city of Morocco
called Beni-Mellal. Since its establishment, Maroc cookies have received an influx of
customers from all over Morocco including tourists visiting the country. This pastry
shop has managed to combine all the wonderful and aromatic flavors of Morocco
into the pastries they produce which resulted in a mass number of customers
coming in. However, Maroc cookies are now experiencing problems in having to
deal with this large number of customers at its establishment from when customers
place their orders up to when they receive their ordered pastries. For this reason,
Maroc cookies would like to cut down the process of ordering at their establishment
by creating a unique online ordering system with a chatbot called Nemo that will
interact with customers and help them place their cookie orders. Nemo should
respond to customers naturally as a normal staff at the Maroc cookies shop. The
customers should be able to perform any of the following using the Maroc cookies
ordering system.
